# Front-end Technical Design Document



#Proposal:

- Our app is designed to help elementary schoolers socially transition to middle school. Our app will help them connect with other students with similar interests. Bubl is a school specific social network and friendship connection tool. 
- User can create an account, join an existing school account, and search for existing bubls to join. They can explore interests through hashtag searches. They can connect with others and share experiences.  
- Mission statement goes here


#Features: 

See Trello board!


#Frameworks: 

- This app will be built with react, less, and some aspects of bootstrap/styled components.
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)


#For Data Scientists:

- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app


#Target Audience: 

- Children with access to the internet that are transitioning from Elementary school to middle school.
- Parents of children transitioning into middle school.
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

#Research:

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.


#Prototype Key Feature(s):

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.

NEED TO LIST FEATURE AND ESTIMATE HOW MUCH TIME IT WILL TAKE
